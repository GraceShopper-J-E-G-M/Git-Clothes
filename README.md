# Git-Clothes

A full stack mock e-commerce website, built by developer team Manimala, Erica, Jessie, and Grace in the Grace Hopper Web Development Immersive program in Winter 2023. 

Note: *This application is deployed at https://git-clothes.onrender.com/ for educational purposes only.*

## Setup

## Start

Sync and seed your database by running `npm run seed`. Running `npm run start:dev` will make great things happen!

- start:dev will both start your server and build your client side files using webpack
- start:dev:logger is the same as start:dev, but you will see your SQL queries (can be helpful for debugging)
- start:dev:seed will start your server and also seed your database (this is useful when you are making schema changes and you don't want to run your seed script separately)
